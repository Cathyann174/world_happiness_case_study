The goal of the case study was to understand what makes people happy abd how is happiness measured.

Data Understanding

The world happiness report 2015-2019 came from Kaggle. It consisted of six factors that measure happiness: generosity, health, economy, family, freedom, and trust. The dataset demonstrated that well-being and happiness are critical indicators of a nationâ€™s economic and social well development. Happiness is increasingly considered a proper measure of social progress and a good public policy.
